        <p>This page is dedicated to rating games I have played because it provides the visitors of my website with a clear insight.
        into the purpose and goal of having other people know my taste in games. My game ratings can vary widely depending on criteria like
        gameplay, graphics, story, and overall experience of the whole game. By highlighting the pros and cons of the games, this page
        helps visitors understand how I rate the games I have played. The whole purpose of this website is to build trust with future visitors.
        especially when it comes to rating, where you need to be completely honest and unbiased. But of course, this is just my personal opinion and is
        subject to change. You may or may not agree with my opinions, and that is completely fine because everyone has different opinions.
        For both casual players and dedicated gamers, knowing my rating criteria can help or make it easier to decide which games might get them interested in.</p>
    
        <p>Additionally, this page serves as a valuable resource for those who are new to the gaming community, guiding them through different genres and factors that contribute to 
       how you enjoy a game. By showcasing specific rating categories and explaining why certain things matter, the visitors themselves can develop a deeper understanding of what makes a 
       game truly enjoyable and unique. This also means that the ratings makes this page not only informative but also educational, encouraging users to play and explore game genres they 
       have never played or touch yet. </p>

        <p>I hope this website encourages gamers or non-gamers to explore and play more games with different genres because it doesn't hurt to try other things.
       The main point of playing games is to have fun and enjoy the moments, memories, and experiences when you play a game. Some games may be single-player or multiplayer
       but depending on what you prefer, the end result should still end in you enjoying the game and being satisfied by it. Make sure when you are playing a game to not get too immersed
       and remember to hydrate and take a break from them, especially when it feels like you've been playing too much or getting frustrated or stressed. Too much of something can lead to something harmful. </p>
